# SpeakGPT

SpeakGPT is a natural language processing model that is similar to ChatGPT, but with the added capability of voice recognition. This allows users to input spoken commands and queries, which are then processed by the model to generate an AI response.

The technology behind SpeakGPT includes a combination of OpenAI's API service, Vitejs, Express, Webkit Speech Recognition, and Vanilla JS. These technologies work together to enable seamless integration of voice recognition and natural language processing, resulting in a more intuitive and efficient user experience.

Vitejs is a build tool that helps to quickly develop and serve JavaScript projects. Express is a web framework for Node.js that allows for easy creation of web applications and APIs. Webkit Speech Recognition is a feature in web browsers that allows for voice recognition and transcription. Vanilla JS is a term used to refer to the standard JavaScript language without any additional libraries or frameworks.

Together, these technologies are used to create a web application that can listen for spoken input, transcribe it to text, and then send it to the OpenAI API for processing. The API then generates a response, which is then sent back to the web application and spoken out loud to the user. This process allows for a smooth and seamless integration of voice recognition and natural language processing, providing a more intuitive and efficient experience for the user.
